            Some of you may have installed Sauce from the Microsoft Add-on's store and I've decided to stop publishing to this location.  Don't fear however, as you can simply uninstall your current version of Sauce and use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sauce-for-strava/eigiefcapdcdmncdghkeahgfmnobigha?hl=en&authuser=0">Chrome Web Store</a> instead.

                The analysis page is an awesome tool by itself.  Sauce builds on this page by adding unique data fields
                and giving you access to the raw data values.  For running and swimming activities this page is un-hidden
                so you can do in-depth analysis regardless of the activity type.

            <p>
                If you own a Garmin device that supports live segments you can now create your own files based on
                ANY activity and ANY athlete.  So if you want to try and beat a friends time from a year ago you can
                go to that activity and create a live segment for that specific effort.  You can even speed up or
                slow down the effort if you want to try and give yourself a new goal. <br/><br/>
                And just one more thing.. It works for downhill segments.  #micdrop #ripsteve

            <p>
                This is my favorite tool in the kit.  You can analyize any segment or section of an activity and study
                what power and weight requirements were used to achieve a particular speed.  It works for time trials,
                hill climbs, and even downhills.  I use this tool to estimate how many watts I'm going to need to
                increase or how many kilograms I'm going to have to drop to meet my goals.

                This is probably the coolest new feature in my opinion.  I'm not a huge fan of dark theme's but this one turned out fantastic.  More themes are coming too..

                Sauce adds GPX and TCX export to any activity, not just your own.  Fun fact: this feature was a real PITA!  I had to

                FTP and weight are both visible and settable.  This can be really handy when you know the athlete
                provided the wrong weight or it's simply not available from Strava.  A really handy feature for getting accurate Watts/kg and TSS.

                Howdy!<br/></br/>

                It's important to me that people know Sauce was created by a real person.
                I started this project for fun in 2015 to add some missing features to strava and to fix a few annoying issues
                like low-contrast text.  This was really just a tool for myself but I thought maybe others would like it too, so
                I published it in the Chrome Web Store without much further thought.<br/><br/>

                The main feature at the time was the <i>Critical Power</i> table inspired by the great TrainingPeaks WKO
                software.  For quite a while that was really the only feature worth noting but I kept making tweaks and adding
                things here and there in my free time, eventually adding run support and now swim
                support.   The critical power table became the selectable "Peak" tables which lets you find all sorts of peak
                performance metrics such as heart rate, VAM (climbing speed), cadence, pace, etc.  I got some great feedback from
                users and eventually Sauce started to really take shape.<br/><br/>

                I like to say Sauce is "social."  At the heart of all these features is the idea that you should be able to use
                them for any public activity, not just your own.  This makes it a great tool for seeing what the best in the world
                are capable of and for comparing your efforts to your friends and frenemies.  While some other 3rd party tools focus on the
                training and planning aspects of strava, Sauce is aimed at providing ubiquitous access to all activities.
                It's the Eric Raymond of strava extensions, if you'll permit the very nerdy reference.<br/><br/>

                Active users have increased over the years. For quite a while there were just a few hundred users, but usage has recently grown to
                over 20,0000 and continues to surge.   Reviews have been pretty great and I've enjoyed working on this project
                more in recent times.<br/><br/>

                So if you think you might like a <i>Sauced</i> up strava experience, give it a try.  If you'd like to help me work
                on this project more, please consider
